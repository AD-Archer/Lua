Welcome to my Lua learning repository! I'm using this space to document and share my progress as I learn Lua. The projects here range from beginner exercises to more complex challenges as I continue to develop my skills in this programming language.

## About This Repo

- This repository contains various Lua scripts that I am working on.
- It's a place where I can experiment, learn, and challenge myself with new concepts in Lua.
- Feel free to explore my code, give suggestions, or even propose new challenges for me to try!

## Getting Involved

If you have an interesting challenge or problem that you think would help me improve my Lua skills, please feel free to create an issue. Here’s how you can contribute:

1. **Create an Issue**: If you have a Lua problem or challenge you want me to work on, create an issue. Be sure to include clear instructions or requirements for the challenge.
2. **Review My Code**: Check out my code and suggest improvements or optimizations.
3. **Provide Feedback**: If you have any feedback on how I can improve my Lua learning journey, I’d love to hear it!

## How to Run Lua Scripts
